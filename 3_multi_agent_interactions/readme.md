Discounted Return 

R^i(t) - biologically motivated

We're trying to adapt the policy parameters to maximize discounted returns

Probability distribution over trajectories

(need formula)

Value function:

Action-value functions


Social dilemmas - type of decision problem where each party's myopic efforts to maximize their own benefit lead to a less favourable outcome compared to when all parties cooperate

Trained with pure RL, agents don't solve the coin problem
With shared reward RL, they do

Learning with Opponent Learning Awareness LOLA

LOLA - limitations

Assumes access to the opponent's policy parameters

Assumption 1 : each agent i learns to maximize their value function

Advantage alignment preserves nash equilibria
