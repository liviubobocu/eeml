# Vast majority of research lacks tangible clinical impact
# High AUCs often represnet marginal gains on small, observational datasets


# For messy data, data processing, cleaning, autoencoders for 
# noise reduction, NN based imputation of missing values(GANS for complex dependencies)

# Sparse data, Advanced imputation techniques
# Biased data

# Algorithms to increase fairness

# Reinforcement learning gains momentum

# dynamic, sequential decision making,

# adapts treatment protocols based on patient specific responses

# chemotherapy dosing, radiation therapy, surgery

# Digital Twins, optimizing health span, resource allocation

# MIMIC IV, i2b2 (entity extraction) MedCAT, spaCy
